/*! \mainpage Estrella device driver for the Stellarnet EPP2000 series of spectrometers.
 *
 * This driver is implemented as a userspace library on top of libusb. It has
 * been written with Linux as a target OS in mind but porting to any libusb
 * supported platform should be easy. If it takes any effort at all.
 *
 * Estrella can only handle USB devices at the moment but should be easily
 * extensible to drive LPT connected equipment. Provided the IEEE-1284
 * communications protocol is known of course.
 * 
 * Feedback to bjoern@shugaa.de is always highly appreciated.

 * from the client. Most of all the contents of estrella sessions. Unfortunately
 * this is not possible when sessions are supposed to be allocated client side
 * as it is right now. The compiler needs to know the size of the session
 * struct. The only way out would be to allocate sessions inside the library
 * which eventually is a bit dangerous with regard to memory management. Yet
 * another option would be to provide a fixed size session store in the lib but
 * this would of course limit the number of sessions the user can create. */
