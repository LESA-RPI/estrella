 * @brief Public driver interface
 *
 * */

/*! \mainpage Estrella device driver for the Stellarnet EPP2000 series of spectrometers.
 *
 * This driver is implemented as a userspace library on top of libusb. It has
 * been written with Linux as a target OS in mind but porting to any libusb
 * supported platform should be easy. If it takes any effort at all.
 *
 * Estrella can only handle USB devices at the moment but should be easily
 * extensible to drive LPT connected equipment. Provided the LPT communications
 * protocol is known of course.
 * 
 * Feedback to bjoern@shugaa.de is always highly appreciated.
