 * bad things will happen if we throw a wrong firmware at it. Correct me if I'm
 * wrong. 
 *
 * So maybe it would be a better idea to provide a simple EPP2000 firmware
 * loading tool. The user could then decide on his own to load firmware to
 * /proc/bus/usb/foo/bar if he's sure it's a EPP2000 device.
 *
 * Anyway, since the USB LPT adapter cable is the only cypress device on my USB
 * bus I'll stick with the automatic firmware uploading for now.
