Here's some instructions on how to build and install estrella.

1. Install libdll

    Estrella uses libdll for some of it's device and session management. You
    need to install libdll before proceeding to install estrella.

    libdll can be obtained from http://github.com/bjoernr/libdll

2. Make sure you have libusb (libusb.sourceforge.net) installed

3. Create Makefiles (cmake needed)
    
    If you want to install into a non-standard location you can modify the
    CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX cmake cache entry to change the destination using the
    following cmake parameter:

        -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/opt/estrella

    You might want to tell cmake if you'd like to build tests or not. You will
    need to have cunit (http://cunit.sourceforge.net/) installed in order to use
    this, otherwise your build will fail:

        -DESTRELLA_WITH_TESTS:BOOL=TRUE

    I would suggest building out of tree, so make yourself a build directory
    somewhere:

        mkdir build
        cd build

    Finally run cmake with any of the above options. I prefixed the cmake
    command with the CFLAGS that I wanted to use, you will probably want to use
    your own ones. If in doubt just omit any CFLAGS.

        CFLAGS="-march=nocona -O2 -pipe -Wall -Werror" cmake [OPTS] /path/to/estrella/src/

4. Build
    
        make

    Running make in your build directory will build the shared estrella library
    and optionally an 'estrella_test' binary which tries to perform a simple scan
    on the first spectrometer device it can find.

5. Install

        make install
